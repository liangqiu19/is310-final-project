## Project Proposal
Jerry Xu and Liang Qiu
### Introduction
  Twitch is a live streaming platform where users are able to livestream themselves playing games, conducting musical broadcasts, or just themselves talking with their viewers. With the COVID-19 pandemic, twitch has seen an influx of new streamers and viewers in the past two years. For this project, we aim to explore the numerous categories and communities that can be found on twitch. Through this exploration, we want to develop and create data visualizations to map how diverse each category or community are. Our main objectives for this project are as the following:
  * Number Of Female streamers and male streamers found within each category
  * Popularity of different languages in each category 

  The reason as to why we decided upon on this topic is because both of us have been users of such platform in the past. With the sudden increase of popularity in twitch, we wanted to revisit twitch and explore the data offered from their API to analyze their demographics while also developing data visualizations (Ex. Graphs, Pie Charts, etc.). 
  
  One outside source in particular that we would be using is twitch tracker. Twitch Tracker is a website where users are able to look at the different statistics found surrounding a streamer. Example of such data that can be found would be streamers’ average viewership, time streamed, and duration of which they are in a certain category. This website also provides us with a better understanding on how we would go about developing data visualizations for this project. Another source we plan on using would be Twitch’s API which would give us access to their data which allows us to explore this topic.
